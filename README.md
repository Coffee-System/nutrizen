## 💡 Our Philosophy

The health app market is broken. We are bombarded with ads, our data is sold, and the algorithms dictating our health are black boxes.

**NutriZen was born to be different.**

Our mission is to create the most complete, reliable, and transparent health tool in the world, and deliver it for free to everyone.

* ✅ **100% Free, Forever:** All essential features will always be free.
* 📢 **Zero Ads:** A clean experience focused on what truly matters: you.
* 📖 **Fully Open Source:** The code is yours to see, audit, and improve.
* 🤝 **Built by the Community:** A project made by developers, designers, nutritionists, and enthusiasts united by a purpose.
