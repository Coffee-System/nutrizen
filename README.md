## 💡 Our Philosophy

The health app market is broken. We are bombarded with ads, our data is sold, and the algorithms dictating our health are black boxes.

Our mission is to create the most complete, reliable, and transparent health tool in the world, and deliver it for free to everyone.

* ✅ **100% Free, Forever:** All essential features will always be free.  
* 📢 **Zero Ads:** A clean experience focused on what truly matters: you.  
* 📖 **Fully Open Source:** The code is yours to see, audit, and improve.  
* 🤝 **Built by the Community:** Developers, designers, nutritionists, and enthusiasts united by purpose.
