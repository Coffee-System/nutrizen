# How to Contribute to NutriZen üò∫

Hello! We are extremely happy about your interest in contributing. NutriZen is a project built **by the community, for the community**. All help is welcome and essential for us to build the world's best open-source health platform together.

This guide is made for everyone, **especially for those who don't code**. We want designers, nutritionists, writers, and enthusiasts to feel at home here.

## Code of Conduct

First and foremost, we expect all community members to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Our goal is to maintain a friendly, respectful, and inclusive environment where everyone feels safe to collaborate.

## Our Contribution Channels

Don't be scared of GitHub! For most contributions, we'll only use two simple tools:

1.  **GitHub Issues:** Think of this as our ideas and tasks board. This is where we suggest new features, report bugs, and discuss design proposals. It's the perfect place to start.
2.  **Discord:** This is our virtual coffee shop, where the community talks in real-time, asks questions, and collaborates more informally. **[Join our Discord here!](https://discord.gg/fHB8xHYBvX)**.
